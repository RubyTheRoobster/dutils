# dutils
A collection of(hopefully)useful modules in the D2 Programming Language.
## Changelog for dutils v0.1.2
### physics.d
An all-new physics simple physics library has been integrated into dutils with this release.  Probably still has much to be desired.
### Documentation Reform
I have revised how I put the documentation, in hopes that it is actually readable when people are viewing the package.
### Addition of Changelogs & README.md Reform
There will now be a file called CHANGELOG.md, which starting with the current release, will serve as a changelog.  In addition, the most recent changelog will be posted on the README.md file.
