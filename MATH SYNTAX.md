# Syntax for dutils.math.\
\
##  Supported Mathematical Types\
\
### Number\
\
The body of a function shall reference a number input as 'x'.\
\
##  Operator Syntax\
\
###  +, -, *, /, and ^^\
\
These operators are applied in the form a op b, where a and b are either numbers or 'x'.\
\
+ is addition, - subtraction, * multiplication, / division, and ^^ is exponentiation.\
\
##  Function Definition Syntax and Rules:\
\
### Rules:\
\
1.  The function definition may not already be registered.\
\
2.  The function body has to have valid syntax.\
\
### Syntax:\
\
All functions definitions with a number input and a number output shall be of the form str(x) = num(num), where str is substituted for the name of the function.\
\
## Removing a function\
\
Removing any function can be done as long as the function is registered and isn't untouchable.  Untouchsable functions are ln(x) = num(num), sin(x) = num(num), cos(x) = num(num),
tan(x) = num(num), csc(x) = num(num), sec(x) = num(num), cot(x) = num(num). Γ(x) = num(num), and δ(x) = num(num).
